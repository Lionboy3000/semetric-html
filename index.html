                    <h2>Facts about cars</h2>
                    <p>Production: Over 80 million cars are produced each year. The highest number of vehicles produced in the last decade was
                    between 2017 and 2018, when an estimated 97 million vehicles were produced.
                    Parking: A typical car spends 95% of its life parked.
                    Airbags: Airbags are designed to work with seat belts, not replace them. Children under 13 should sit in the back seat.
                    Roads: Roads were originally built for bicycles, and the automobile developed from the bike.
                    Electric cars: The first electric car was produced in 1828, but the fashion for this type of car declined and wasn't
                    revived until the 1990s.
                    Braking: Electric cars use regenerative braking, which recovers energy when the vehicle slows down and sends it back
                    into the battery.
                    Recycling: 80% of an average car is recyclable.
                    Traffic: The average US driver spends 42 hours per year stuck in traffic.
